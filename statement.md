# X-mas Rush Post Mortem

This contest was a lot of fun for me. Also very intense because of the close fight between number 1 and number 2. I ended at rank 2, which is a personal record for me. Very happy with the result. In this post mortem I will try to explain the main things I think I did right and also the things that didn't work for me.

## Simulation

This contest was hard for beginners to get into. This is mainly because of the necessity of a push simulation. Push is complex in that you need to take into account pushes by both players on 7 possible different rows and columns. The difficulty depends greatly on your choice of board representation. I decided to go with a "bitboard". This is a difficult to handle board representation that is very fast.

Bitboards can be efficiÃ«nt because they use less memory and be quickly modified using bit operator. My board was an int[9]. The first 7 elements were 7 map rows, the 8th integer was my hand tile and the 9th integer was my opponents hand tile. One of those integer map rows could look like this in terms of individual bits:  1001 0111 1110 1111 0011 1100 1010 
Basically I used the map tiles we are given as input and only convert them to bits. You can do this as follows:

```C++

int StringToBits(string s)
{
	int binary = 0;

	for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
	{
		if (s[i] == '1')
			binary += 1 << (3 - i);
	}
	return binary;
}
```

For quests and players I used a similar representation. For players the first 4 bits where the x -coordinate (could have used 3, reasons below). The next 3 bits where the y-coordinate. I use a player[2] array. I don't track items, only quests. In hindsight I missed an opportunity due to this lack of item tracking, more on that later. For quests I used the same coordinate representation, only I put the item id on bits 7 to 10 and the tile code (1100 etc.) on bits 11 to 14. In this way, everything is represented in integers, which makes sure I can do a fast push method.


My Push code you can find below. I show about half of it because it is a big method, but it should be easy to extend to include all possibilities.


```C++

void PushMap() //true = column, true = up or left
{
	if (nodeId[0] == nodeId[1] && rowCol[0] == rowCol[1])
		return; // This is to stop the method when deadlocked

	for (int player = 0; player < 2; player++) // two player pushes
	{
		if (rowCol[player]) // is it a row push?
		{
			int id = nodeId[player]; // which row is being pushed?
			int mapRow = mapCopy[id]; // the map row that is being pushed
			int handTile = mapCopy[7 + player]; // the hand tile of this player
			if (leftUp[player])  // is it pushed left?
			{
				mapCopy[7 + player] = (mapRow >> 24) & 15;  
				// the left most tile is pushed off and placed in hand.
				mapCopy[id] = (mapRow << 4) | handTile; 
				// the map row is shifted 4 bits (1 tile) to the left and the handtile is added

				for (int i = 0; i < 12; i++) 
				{
				// loop over all tracked quests (I track 6 per player, 3 current and 3 next if known
				
					int quest = questsCopy[i]; 

					if (quest == 9) 
						continue; 
					// the quest is 9 if no quest exists in this slot. 	
                    // I use this 9 because 0 to 6 are x coordinates in the row, 7 is my handtile and 8 is the opponents.
					int x = quest & 15; // take the right 4 bits for x

					if (x == 7 + player) // if the quest is in my hand, place it on the board.
					{
						quest &= ~127; 
					// clear the x and y coordinates. ~127 means NOT 127 setting the first 7 bits to 0.
						quest |= 6 | (id << 4); 
					// OR with 6 (the right most x coordinate and with y shifted 4 to the left.
						questsCopy[i] = quest; 
					// set to array
					}
					else if (x < 7) // the quest is on the board
					{
						int y = (quest >> 4) & 7; // get the y coordinate
						if (y == id) // is the y coordinate equal to the row being pushed?
						{
							x--; // reduce the x coordinate because of the push to the left
							quest &= (~127); // clear coordinates;
							if (x < 0) // pushed off the board? Then take in hand
								quest |= (7 + player);
							else
								quest |= x | (y << 4); 
						    // otherwise set the new coordinates
							questsCopy[i] = quest;
						}
					}
				}

				for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
				{
					int y = playerPosCopy[i] >> 4; // get player y by shifting 4 to the right

					if (y == id) // is the player on the row being pushed?
					{
						int x = playerPosCopy[i] & 7; // get the x 
						x--;  

						if (x < 0) // x smaller than 0? Then set to the other side of the board.
							x = 6;
						playerPosCopy[i] = x | (id << 4);
					}
				}
			}
			else
			{
			    // similar for the other direction.
			}
		}
	}
	
	// At this point all row pushes are done. Columns are next

	for (int player = 0; player < 2; player++)
	{
		if (!rowCol[player]) // this is a column being pushed
		{
			int id = nodeId[player];
			int handTile = mapCopy[7 + player];
			int shift = (6 - id) * 4; // The amount a row has to be shifted to expose the pushed column tiles
			int clear = ~(15 << shift); // This us used to clear the column in the spot that is being pushed.
			if (leftUp[player])
			{
				mapCopy[7 + player] = (mapCopy[0] >> shift) & 15; // take the tile on the

				for (int i = 1; i < 7; i++) // 
				{
					int tile = (mapCopy[i] >> shift) & 15;
					mapCopy[i - 1] &= clear;
					mapCopy[i - 1] |= (tile << shift);
				}

				mapCopy[6] &= clear;
				mapCopy[6] |= (handTile << shift);

				for (int i = 0; i < 12; i++)
				{
					int quest = questsCopy[i];

					if (quest == 9)
						continue;
					int x = quest & 15;

					if (x == 7 + player)
					{
						quest &= (~127); // clear coordinates;
						quest |= id | (6 << 4);
						questsCopy[i] = quest;
					}
					else if (x < 7)
					{
						if (x == id)
						{
							int y = (quest >> 4) & 7;
							y--;
							quest &= (~127); // clear coordinates;
							if (y < 0)
								quest |= (7 + player);

								quest |= x | (y << 4);
							questsCopy[i] = quest;
						}
					}
				}

				for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
				{
					int x = playerPosCopy[i] & 7;

					if (x == id)
					{
						int y = playerPosCopy[i] >> 4;
						y--;

						if (y < 0)
							y = 6;
						playerPosCopy[i] = id | (y << 4); // set the new player position
					}
				}
			}
			else
			{
			    // similar for the other direction
			}
		}
	}
}

```

 Because it is such a big piece of code, it may seem slow, but most of it is ignored during a run because of the branching. I could have thought more about condensing it to remove similar code, but it works and it would not become faster by condensing it. I unit tested the method by printing the map before and after push. To do this I used:

```C++

string printCodes[]
{
	"", "", "", "\u2557", "", "\u2550", "\u2554", "\u2566", "", "\u255D", "\u2551", "\u2563", "\u255A", "\u2569", "\u2560", "\u256C"
};

```

This outputs a pretty map picture when using lookups with those strings converted to bits I showed above.
